# Desktop Twitter
This application acts as a desktop wrapper for Twitter, using WPF and the Tweetinvi C# Library to allow the user to send Tweets, follow other accounts, view private messages, and much more. This project was created in a small group as a part of a final project for an Object Oriented Programming course. 
### Goals
While the primary focus of the project was to fufill the instructor's desires (have an application login, read and write to a text file, ect.), our group added the following goals for the project.
* Follow SOLID Principles and the MVVM design pattern
* Create an intuitive and easy-to-use UI
* Add additional features, such as more advanced searching tools and ability to view individual user timelines
